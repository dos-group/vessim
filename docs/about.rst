About Vessim
============

Vessim is being developed at the research group for `Distributed and Operating
Systems (DOS) <https://www.dos.tu-berlin.de>`_ at TU Berlin.
Development is funded by the `Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) <https://www.bmbf.de/>`_ as part of the Software Campus project `SYNERGY <https://softwarecampus.de/en/projekt/synergy-synergies-of-distributed-artificial-intelligence-and-renewable-energy-generation/>`_ under the lead of `Philipp Wiesner <https://philippwiesner.org>`_.

After researching on energy-aware and carbon-aware computing systems for several years, we noticed how almost all scientific evaluations are simulation-based, as (globally distributed) hardware testbeds are rare and expensive to build and maintain.
Vessim tries to simplify and unify such evaluations and enables the continuous testing of new applications.
Active development of Vessim started in March 2023.

Many thanks to our team which worked on Vessim for more than a year now:

- Marvin Steinke
- Paul Kilian
- Amanda Malkowski
